# Implementation Plan: New Arabic Grammatical Constructions

## 🎯 **Objective**
Implement two new grammatical construction detectors following CRITICAL_OPERATIONAL_DIRECTIVES.md:
- **الموصوف والصفة** (Qualified Noun–Adjective)
- **الفعل والفاعل** (Verb + Subject)

## 📋 **Critical Operational Directives Compliance**

✅ **Documentation-First Approach**
- Create comprehensive type definitions before implementation
- Document all linguistic rules and detection logic
- Provide clear examples and test cases

✅ **Additive Changes Only**
- Extend existing word-level construction detection system
- Maintain backward compatibility with current constructions
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces

✅ **Comprehensive Testing**
- Unit tests for each new detector
- Integration tests with existing system
- Sample data validation

- [x] Update `UserSelection.relationshipType` enum
- [x] Add new construction types to statistics tracking
- [x] Update quiz settings to support new construction filters

### 1.2 Enhanced Morphology Support
- [ ] Add `isDefinite` property to `MorphologicalDetails` interface
- [ ] Extend `GrammaticalRelationship.type` enum with new types
- [ ] Add new roles: `mawsoof`, `sifah`, `fi3l`, `fa3il`
- [ ] Update morphology inference logic for definiteness detection

### 1.3 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Create `MAWSOOF_SIFAH_DETECTION.md` with linguistic rules
- [ ] Create `FI3L_FA3IL_DETECTION.md` with verb-subject rules
- [ ] Update main Grammar Quiz documentation

- [ ] Update quiz settings UI to filter new constructions

### 4.3 Help & Learning Resources
- [ ] Add tooltip explanations for new constructions
- [ ] Create example sentences with highlighted constructions
- [ ] Add textbook rule references
- [ ] Update user guide documentation

---

## 🏗️ **Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance**

### 5.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Test cases for `mawsoofSifahDetector.ts`
- [ ] Test cases for `fi3lFa3ilDetector.ts`
- [ ] Test agreement validation logic
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

### 5.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with existing word-level detection system
- [ ] Test with real Quranic verse data
- [ ] Test UI interaction and feedback
- [ ] Performance testing with new detectors

### 5.3 Linguistic Validation
- [ ] Validate against classical Arabic grammar rules
- [ ] Test with expert Arabic grammar review
- [ ] Verify construction counts are realistic (4-8 per verse)
- [ ] Cross-reference with traditional grammar texts

---

## 🏗️ **Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment**

### 6.1 Technical Documentation
- [ ] API documentation for new detectors
- [ ] Integration guide for developers
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization notes
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
