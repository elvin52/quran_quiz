## Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis & Debugging

### 3.1 Issue Reproduction
- [ ] **Create Test Cases**
  - [ ] ✅ Select only jar-majroor → Should work
  - [ ] ❌ Select jar-majroor + idafa → Currently fails  
  - [ ] ✅ Select partial jar-majroor (just preposition) → Should work
  - [ ] ✅ Select partial jar-majroor (just noun) → Should work
  - [ ] Test with various verse combinations
- [ ] **Document Current Behavior**
  - [ ] Screenshot failing scenarios
  - [ ] Record console output
  - [ ] Note specific error patterns

### 3.2 Data Flow Tracing
- [ ] **Add Comprehensive Logging**
  ```typescript
  // Add to validation method:
  console.log('=== VALIDATION DEBUG START ===');
  console.log('User relationshipType:', relationshipType);
  console.log('Available construction types:', Object.keys(groupedConstructions));
  console.log('User selection spans:', userSelection);
  console.log('=== VALIDATION DEBUG END ===');
  ```
- [ ] **Track Key Variables**
  - [ ] `relationshipType` construction at various points
  - [ ] `userIdentified` boolean logic results
  - [ ] Span matching calculations
  - [ ] Final scoring decisions

### 3.3 Bottleneck Identification
- [ ] **Analyze String Matching Logic**
  ```typescript
  // Current problematic code:
  const userIdentified = relationshipType === type;
  // When: relationshipType = "jar-majroor,mudaf-mudaf-ilayh"
  // Check: "jar-majroor,mudaf-mudaf-ilayh" === "jar-majroor" → FALSE
  ```
- [ ] **Identify Secondary Issues**

  ```
- [ ] **Test Immediate Fix**

  ```typescript
  const normalizeSelectionType = (type: string): string[] => {
    return type.split(',').map(t => t.trim()).filter(Boolean);
  };
  ```
- [ ] **Implement Robust Validation Pipeline**
  ```typescript
  const validateConstructionType = (
    userTypes: string[], 
    expectedType: string, 
    spans: number[][]
  ): ValidationResult => {
    // Sophisticated matching logic
  };
  ```
- [ ] **Add Special Case Handlers**
  ```typescript
  const jarMajroorValidator = {
    requiresPartialMatching: true,
    giveFullCreditOnTypeMatch: true,
    validationStrategy: 'lenient'
  };
  ```

### 4.3 Integration & State Management
