## Implementation Plan

### Technical Architecture
- **Framework Integration**: React component within existing Vite/TypeScript stack
- **Routing**: New `/quiz/pronouns` route using React Router
- **State Management**: Custom hooks for quiz state, session tracking, and analytics
- **Data Storage**: Local storage for session persistence, structured logging for analytics
- **UI Integration**: Consistent with existing shadcn/ui components and TailwindCSS styling

### Core Components Structure
1. **PronounQuizPage**: Main page component with quiz orchestration
2. **QuizQuestion**: Individual question display with Arabic text rendering
3. **PronounSelector**: Interactive pronoun selection interface
4. **QuizFeedback**: Immediate feedback with correctness and timing
5. **SessionSummary**: End-of-session statistics and performance review
6. **QuizAnalytics**: Response time tracking and performance metrics

### Data Architecture
- **QuizQuestion Interface**: question_id, verb, expected_answer, options, difficulty
- **QuizSession Interface**: session_id, questions, responses, timestamps, performance_metrics
- **QuizResponse Interface**: question_id, user_answer, correct_answer, response_time, timestamp
- **Analytics Schema**: JSON structure for storing detailed performance data

### Content Requirements
- Bank of 50+ common present-tense Arabic verbs with proper diacritization
- Complete set of Arabic pronouns (independent and attached forms)
- Question generation logic for both identification and selection tasks
- Difficulty progression system (basic → intermediate → advanced)

### Integration Points
- Navigation integration with existing header/bottom navigation
- Consistent Arabic text rendering with current font and RTL handling
- Color scheme alignment with existing morphology highlighting
- Responsive design matching current mobile-first approach

This feature will provide users with systematic practice for Arabic pronoun usage while maintaining the educational focus and technical quality of the existing application.
